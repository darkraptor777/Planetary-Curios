 mawlurk_site:0 "Buried Fate"
 mawlurk_site_intro:0 "The surface of [From.Planet.GetName] is covered in ruined cities and settlements with no sign of their inhabitants. Large areas of some cities are half-buried, the ground seeming to have collapsed beneath them."
 curio.101.name:0 "Buried Fate"
 curio.101.desc:0 "Based on dozens of pieces of media we've recovered [From.Planet.GetName] was divided between a number of different factions, each controlling various regions of the planet. One faction in particular named §H"The United Front"§! seems to have been the dominant topic of most of the diplomatic communications between the other factions, with many signing treaties of mutual defence against them. As for which region the United Front resided in it is harder to discern; the borders between these factions, as important as they must have once seemed, have been long forgotten."
 curio.101.a:0 "Keep Searching!"
 curio.102.name:0 "The United Front"
 curio.102.desc:0 "A breakthrough in finding the location of the United Front was finally reached when a map in remarkably good condition was discovered. Curiously, the region they once ruled over seems to have suffered the worst of the destruction wrought across the planet. Most structures here are almost completely buried beneath the surface, with a few of the more prominent buildings poking out above ground. Based on additional media recovered during the search tensions between the United Front and the other factions were high during the final years before their demise, the popular theory among our scientists is that somehow they brought about eachothers destruction."
 curio.102.a:0 "Curious Indeed."
 curio.103.name:0 "The United Front"
 curio.103.desc:0 "The central administrative building of the United Front has been discovered. The structure itself is a grand and imposing one even in its decrepit state. It seems the building also served a role in the military and several documents refer to the developement of a weapon, codename §H"Project Mawlurk"§!, it's developement being so close to the demise of it's creators can hardly be a coincidence. Details are scarce about the exact nature of the weapon leaving many questions unanswered, but the bunker beneath the building seems like it may hold some answers. Now if only the blast doors would open."
 curio.103.a:0 "Get those doors open!"
 curio.104.name:0 "Project Mawlurk"
 curio.104.desc:0 "The thick blast doors were not easy to open, the dig team eventually managed to partially restore power to the door and pry them open with heavy duty equipment. Within is a fortified military research facility, with documents ranging from threat analyses of foreign factions to methods of improving their own arsenal. More detailed reports on Project Mawlurk reveal that it was kept secure in its own section of the facility and that there had been numerous 'accidents' involving the weapon, with several scientists being injured or in some cases outright killed. The United Front kept the developement of this weapon a secret even from their own populace, planning to unveil it by putting it to use against one of their older and more vocal rival factions. It seems their weapon may have been more effective than they ever could have hoped..."
 curio.104.a:0 "We must find it!"
 curio.105.name:0 "The Egg"
 curio.105.desc:0 "Deeper inside the bunker the dig team discover an even more heavily fortified vault. The entrace is unhinged and partially melted from the inside. The interior is in substantially worse condition, holes several feet across sporadically cover the room and burrow deep into the ground. Amongst the rubble is a large pulsating orb with tendrils and a gaping maw. Security footage shows what [Root.GetLeaderName] describes as the orb birthing several large lithotroph worms, which made short work of the scientists sent to collect them as well as the vaults fortifications. From there our scientists extrapolate the creatures quickly got out of control, bringing ruin to much of the United Front's territory. The other factions, unaware and unprepared for these creatures soon followed suit."
 curio.105.a:0 "We must use these creatures with great caution."
 
 gilded_sun_site:0 "Amongst Clouds"
 gilded_sun_site_intro:0 "A citadel city sits atop one of the highest regions of [From.Planet.GetName]. The place is long abandoned, it's bustling streets and alleyways must have been a sight to behold when the city was populated. Now only the clouds stalk through it's paved network."
 curio.111.name:0 "A Higher Calling"
 curio.111.desc:0 "Our expeditions have revealed that the civilisation here was extremely spiritualistic, to an almost fanatical degree. With religion dominating day-to-day life in the city, dictating everything from what job a citizen would have to how to properly arrange dining cutlery. Many documents, both of religious and political nature, refer to §H"The Church of the Gilded Sun"§!."
 curio.112.name:0 "Church of the Gilded Sun"
 curio.112.desc:0 "§H"The Church of the Gilded Sun"§! worshiped a deification of a star. Curiously however they did not worship [Root.Solar_System.GetName], which numerous texts refer to as a false god. Rather they worship §G"The Great Green Gilded Sun"§!. Details are sparse and many of our scientists are baffled as to what kind of stellar body they could be referring to, assuming it even exists at all."
 curio.113.name:0 "The Voyage"
 curio.113.desc:0 "The lastest findings by the expedition have shed light on what happened to the cities populace. The church appears to have been in preparations for an exodus, constructing an enormous ship so that they might travel to the §HGilded Sun§!. All activities in the city were shifted to assist with this plan, it was hailed as a moment everyone had been waiting for."
 curio.114.name:0 "The Voyage"
 curio.114.desc:0 "At long last a space chart was discovered by the expedition. It is incredibly primitive and plots a route through several star systems, ending at the §HGilded Sun§!. What took some time to figure out however was that the route did not start at [Root.Solar_System.GetName]. Indeed it appears the populace had been journeying for generations, stopping every so often whenever thay ran out of resources."

 gilded_sun_site2:0 "Journeys End"
 gilded_sun_site2_intro:0 "The final destination for §H"The Church of the Gilded Sun"§! has at last been found. However [From.Planet.GetName] is long abandoned and the church long dead. It seems whatever disaster may have befallen them they did not live to tell the tale."
 curio.120.name:0 "A Setting Sun"
 curio.120.desc:0 "With their ultimate goal fufilled the church organised many celebrations and festivals for the citizens. Praising their hardwork, effort and ability to endure the centuries long journey here. With their purpose fufilled the church saw fit to relinquish most of their power and put together a civillian lead goverment. Hopes were high as the populace looked onwards to the start of a new era."
 curio.121.name:0 "Without Purpose"
 curio.121.desc:0 "Based of what few artifacts exist that can be dated after this point it seems the new government did not last long. Many citizens struggled to adapt to the new way of life, with generations having dedicated their entire existence to travelling to this star the lack of such a clear purpose filled much of the population with an existential dread. The goverment tried it's best to help stabilise things though intervention initiatives and propaganda, but several high profile mass suicides eroded the publics confidence in the goverment as well as their sanity.\nMany, many mass deaths soon followed.\n\nIt is believed that some survived these difficult times however they seem to have collectively decided to not procreate any further. Having seen their friends, family, neighbours and coworkers all take their own lives a decision was reached to not curse their offspring with this purposelessness."
 
 the_network_site:0 "Beneath the Sands"
 the_network_site_intro:0 "Scans have picked up a small building partly buried by the desert sands. Curiously the interior of the building spans a vast network of rooms and tunnels below the planets surface which appear to extend far outside the range of our scanners..."
 curio.130.name:0 "The Dunes Have Eyes"
 curio.130.desc:0 "The expedition has struggled to get past the first hurdle. The underground complex is sealed off behind a set of cyclopean doors which have yet to be successfully opened despite the expeditions best efforts, less delicate methods not withstanding. The atmosphere among the expedition has grown increasingly paranoid as a number of individuals have reported the feeling of being watched which has not been helped by the recent discovery that the dunes shift in abnormal directions, even moving crosswind. The cause of this enviromental behaviour is currently unknown."
 curio.131.name:0 "The Network"
 curio.131.desc:0 "The doors have finally been opened by the dig team after painstakingly decyphering what can best be described as glyphs or runes. Beyond the doors spans the vast labyrinthian underground network of rooms and corridors. However the structure beyond appears far more technologically advanced than the dusty stone of the surface ruins, leading some among the expedition to speculate the stone ruins served as some kind of disguise or serve some aesthetic purpose. Preliminary exploration of the network has proven difficult as the structure itself appears to be inhibiting wireless communication."
 curio.132.name:0 "The Network"
 curio.132.desc:0 "The dig team has made some headway after devising a system of cables to prevent getting lost in the vast network of rooms and passageways, setting up a base at the entrance to report findings back to. Of the rooms explored so far all seem to be devoid of any semblance of purpose. At times some rooms are impossibly vast and empty in others they are confusingly narrow with the expedition barely squeezing through. Their layouts are often contradictory and at times almost purposely difficult to navigate, objects that might be loosely interpreted as 'furniture' is often found in odd and unexpected locations in seemingly pointless configurations. As for who lived here and for what purpose has not been assertained however speculation among the expedition runs rampant with one popular thoey being that this is the result of some architectural AI gone rogue."
 curio.133.name:0 "Loose Ends"
 curio.133.desc:0 "The most recent reports from the expedition are troubling. Reportedly severed cables of the same design as the ones used by the dig team have been discovered in regions of the network not yet explored. The concern for the potential for live and hostile entities within the network has been raised and the expedition has been authorised to use lethal force as a last resort. In more enlightening news the expedition has found and recovered some alien technology and seemingly in line with some speculation the tech appears to predominately be of importance to AI. Although evidence of any kind of achitectural AI has yet to be recovered."
 curio.134.name:0 "Loose Ends"
 curio.134.desc:0 "The expedition team has reported some startling findings. Additional severed cables of the same design have been discovered, incomplete and brief analysis of the cables indicated that they snapped under immense strain rather than having been deliberately cut. Attempts to recreate this have been unsuccessful. Following this the team elected to follow one of the discovered cables in an effort to establish who or what had left them there. Reportedly it was not long before the remains were found. Almost completely decomposed and wearing the same equipment as some of the crew members, cause of death was not able to be established. [Root.GetLeaderName] reports that these discoveries have caused significant unease amongst the dig team."
 curio.135.name:0 "Sealed Beneath the Sands"
 curio.135.desc:0 "An unscheduled transmission from [Root.GetLeaderName] has been received. They report that the entire expedition team has been lost and are presumed unrecoverable or worse. [Root.GetLeaderName]'s account of events details that tether used for navigation by the expedition team went slack. It was quickly discovered that the tether had silently snapped a short distance out of view of the main camp, but the rest of the tether and crew were nowhere to be found. The transmission ends with [Root.GetLeaderName] incoherently babbling about needing to seal §R"Its Wound"§! before turning around and detonating a large amount of excavation explosives positioned behind them."
 
 sleepers_site:0 "Storage Complex"
 sleepers_site_intro:0 "A large industrial warhouse complex has been discovered on [From.Planet.GetName]. It appears to have been abandoned long ago, however scans reveal that there are bio-signitures deep within the central facility. There do not appear to be any life signs in the smaller storage facilities sorrounding the area."
 curio.140.name:0 "Rusty Works"
 curio.140.desc:0 "A search of the external, smaller storage facilities has been conducted by the dig team. Documents recovered reveal that this site was a depot of sorts which stored minerals mined from nearby asteroids. These minerals would then be delivered elsewhere to be processed or refined. The derelict machinery, despite it's current condition, it's relatively similar to our own with some of it's own distinguishing features. All the storage crates recovered so far have been empty, despite being sealed and seemingly ready to be shipped."
 curio.141.name:0 "Rusty Works"
 curio.141.desc:0 "Security inside the central facility has proven more difficult to bypass than in the smaller sites. Giant metal doors seprate the facility into different sections, each with it's own numbered designation. Dozens of stacked crates and boxes litter the room, some are even protected with mag-locks and yet all that were searched were empty. \n\nThe crew managed to restore power to one of the terminals within the facility, partial logs detail information about the entire complex going into an emergency shutdown. Aside from some meaningless alarm codes the reason for the shutdown is not elaborated on at all, just that the shutdown would last an undetermined amount of time. At the suggestion of [Root.GetLeaderName] crew members will proceed in biohazard suits incase the bio-signatures detected are the cause of the shutdown."
 curio.142.name:0 "Those Who Sleep"
 curio.142.desc:0 "Progress through the facility has been slowed down due to needing to open the large metal doors that seperate the different sections. However after exploring numerous sections of the facility the crew encountered multiple grey bipeds all stood completely still and unresponsive. They do appear to be photo-sensitive however, with light exposure causing minor muscle convulsions. This is despite them being, by all medical measures, deceased. They are being treated with the unmost caution so that they are not disturbed. \n\nBased on images recovered elsewhere on the site these creatures are not the architects of the facility, their appearance and bone structure differ greatly. These grey bipeds have been dubbed §H'Sleepers'§! by crew members due to their partial, sleep-like, responsiveness. Portable scanners have picked up a life sign deeper within the facility and the crew is determined to press forwards and find it's source."
 curio.143.name:0 "Those Who Sleep"
 curio.143.desc:0 "Dozens of more §HSleepers§! have been encountered by the crew, with the number of them seemingly increasing as the crew get closer and closer to the source of the life-sign. Additional storage objects have been encountered as well, including primitive stasis-caskets with their occupants long expired. The occupants however, are of much more interest than their caskets as they match images and descriptions of the species that built the facility. Based on their clothing and the rudimentary imformation each stasis-casket stored on it's occupant they appear to all have been high ranking workers at the facility when it was operational. It is believed they entered these stasis-caskets when the facility lockdown began in an effort to protect themselves."
 curio.144.name:0 "Dream-ridden"
 curio.144.desc:0 "Finally the crew has made it to the source of the bio-signatures. This chamber is significantly larger than the others, with the ceiling being concealed in shadow and large pentagonal tubes descending from it's depths and covering the walls. The tubes all connect to a single, giant casket stood upright in the centre of the room. Vitals indicated that the gargantuan creature housed inside was alive, but regrettably efforts to open the casket ended in it's termination. Despite this good news abounds, autopsies carried out on the creature have provided insight into how we might apply genetic improvements to some of our citizens."

 curio.150.name:0 "Harbingers of Annihilation"
 curio.150.desc:0 "Initial examinations indicate that this planet succumbed to nuclear devestation. Digital archives recovered describe a shadowy cult which was believed to have infiltrated almost every governing body on the planet. The apparent goal of the self proclaimed §HHarbingers of Annihilation§!, was to bring about the end of the world. It was widely speculated they planned to do this by detonating neuclear weapons that had been stockpiled during a period of tense international relations. It would appear they were successful."
 curio.151.name:0 "Mutated Bones"
 curio.151.desc:0 "Several well preserved skeletal remains have been recovered, analysis shows that all individuals suffered from terrible skeletal abberations and appear to have fallen to a number of mutations which were likely fatal. As expected the remains are all highly radioactive, more surprising however, is that the remains pre-date the predicted time at which the nuclear detonations occured."
 curio.152.name:0 "Unseen Threat"
 curio.152.desc:0 "[Root.GetLeaderName] has reached the conclusion that the civilization on [From.Planet.GetName] fell victim to a planet-wide plague. Other artifacts recovered indicate that the scope of the §HHarbingers of Annihilation's§! operations were insignificant and that they had no involvment this planet-wide catastophy. It is believed that the nuclear devestation observed was merely the result of the various nuclear stockpiles slowly falling into disrepair and detonating due to malfunctions, erasing most of what this civilisation left behind."
