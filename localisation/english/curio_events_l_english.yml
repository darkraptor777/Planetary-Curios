 curio.10001.name:0 "Curious Crystals"
 curio.10001.desc:0 "Upon further investigation the region around the crystals is exceptionally mineral rich. As for the crystals themselves their composition is something we had previously thought was not possible, the process behind their formation is still something of a mystery however the rate at which they form is surprisingly quick."

 curio.10002.name:0 "Deep Ocean Station"
 curio.10002.desc:0 "Our subnautical team reports that the great structure is some sort of research station built in the furthest depths of [From.GetName].

However there is no trace of the stations architects nor inhabitants, the place seemingly abandoned before it was ever put to use."
 curio.10002.a:0 "How curious."

 # Dig Sites
 ####################################
 mawlurk_site:0 "Buried Fate"
 mawlurk_site_intro:0 "The surface of [From.Planet.GetName] is covered in ruined cities and settlements with no sign of their inhabitants. Large areas of some cities are half-buried, the ground seeming to have collapsed beneath them."
 curio.101.name:0 "Buried Fate"
 curio.101.desc:0 "Based on dozens of pieces of media we've recovered [From.Planet.GetName] was divided between a number of different factions, each controlling various regions of the planet. One faction in particular named §H"The United Front"§! seems to have been the dominant topic of most of the diplomatic communications between the other factions, with many signing treaties of mutual defence against them. As for which region the United Front resided in it is harder to discern; the borders between these factions, as important as they must have once seemed, have been long forgotten."
 curio.101.a:0 "Keep Searching!"
 curio.102.name:0 "The United Front"
 curio.102.desc:0 "A breakthrough in finding the location of the United Front was finally reached when a map in remarkably good condition was discovered. Curiously, the region they once ruled over seems to have suffered the worst of the destruction wrought across the planet. Most structures here are almost completely buried beneath the surface, with a few of the more prominent buildings poking out above ground. Based on additional media recovered during the search tensions between the United Front and the other factions were high during the final years before their demise, the popular theory among our scientists is that somehow they brought about eachothers destruction."
 curio.102.a:0 "Curious Indeed."
 curio.103.name:0 "The United Front"
 curio.103.desc:0 "The central administrative building of the United Front has been discovered. The structure itself is a grand and imposing one even in its decrepit state. It seems the building also served a role in the military and several documents refer to the developement of a weapon, codename §H"Project Mawlurk"§!, it's developement being so close to the demise of it's creators can hardly be a coincidence. Details are scarce about the exact nature of the weapon leaving many questions unanswered, but the bunker beneath the building seems like it may hold some answers. Now if only the blast doors would open."
 curio.103.a:0 "Get those doors open!"
 curio.104.name:0 "Project Mawlurk"
 curio.104.desc:0 "The thick blast doors were not easy to open, the dig team eventually managed to partially restore power to the door and pry them open with heavy duty equipment. Within is a fortified military research facility, with documents ranging from threat analyses of foreign factions to methods of improving their own arsenal. More detailed reports on Project Mawlurk reveal that it was kept secure in its own section of the facility and that there had been numerous 'accidents' involving the weapon, with several scientists being injured or in some cases outright killed. The United Front kept the developement of this weapon a secret even from their own populace, planning to unveil it by putting it to use against one of their older and more vocal rival factions. It seems their weapon may have been more effective than they ever could have hoped..."
 curio.104.a:0 "We must find it!"
 curio.105.name:0 "The Egg"
 curio.105.desc:0 "Deeper inside the bunker the dig team discover an even more heavily fortified vault. The entrace is unhinged and partially melted from the inside. The interior is in substantially worse condition, holes several feet across sporadically cover the room and burrow deep into the ground. Amongst the rubble is a large pulsating orb with tendrils and a gaping maw. Security footage shows what [Root.GetLeaderName] describes as the orb birthing several large lithotroph worms, which made short work of the scientists sent to collect them as well as the vaults fortifications. From there our scientists extrapolate the creatures quickly got out of control, bringing ruin to much of the United Front's territory. The other factions, unaware and unprepared for these creatures soon followed suit."
 curio.105.a:0 "We must use these creatures with great caution."
 
 gilded_sun_site:0 "Amongst Clouds"
 gilded_sun_site_intro:0 "A citadel city sits atop one of the highest regions of [From.Planet.GetName]. The place is long abandoned, it's bustling streets and alleyways must have been a sight to behold when the city was populated. Now only the clouds stalk through it's paved network."
 curio.111.name:0 "A Higher Calling"
 curio.111.desc:0 "Our expeditions have revealed that the civilisation here was extremely spiritualistic, to an almost fanatical degree. With religion dominating day-to-day life in the city, dictating everything from what job a citizen would have to how to properly arrange dining cutlery. Many documents, both of religious and political nature, refer to §H"The Church of the Gilded Sun"§!."
 curio.112.name:0 "Church of the Gilded Sun"
 curio.112.desc:0 "§H"The Church of the Gilded Sun"§! worshiped a deification of a star. Curiously however they did not worship [Root.Solar_System.GetName], which numerous texts refer to as a false god. Rather they worship §G"The Great Green Gilded Sun"§!. Details are sparse and many of our scientists are baffled as to what kind of stellar body they could be referring to, assuming it even exists at all."
 curio.113.name:0 "The Voyage"
 curio.113.desc:0 "The lastest findings by the expedition have shed light on what happened to the cities populace. The church appears to have been in preparations for an exodus, constructing an enormous ship so that they might travel to the §HGilded Sun§!. All activities in the city were shifted to assist with this plan, it was hailed as a moment everyone had been waiting for."
 curio.114.name:0 "The Voyage"
 curio.114.desc:0 "At long last a space chart was discovered by the expedition. It is incredibly primitive and plots a route through several star systems, ending at the §HGilded Sun§!. What took some time to figure out however was that the route did not start at [Root.Solar_System.GetName]. Indeed it appears the populace had been journeying for generations, stopping every so often whenever thay ran out of resources."

 gilded_sun_site2:0 "Journeys End"
 gilded_sun_site2_intro:0 "The final destination for §H"The Church of the Gilded Sun"§! has at last been found. However [From.Planet.GetName] is long abandoned and the church long dead. It seems whatever disaster may have befallen them they did not live to tell the tale."
 curio.120.name:0 "A Setting Sun"
 curio.120.desc:0 "With their ultimate goal fufilled the church organised many celebrations and festivals for the citizens. Praising their hardwork, effort and ability to endure the centuries long journey here. With their purpose fufilled the church saw fit to relinquish most of their power and put together a civillian lead goverment. Hopes were high as the populace looked onwards to the start of a new era."
 curio.121.name:0 "Without Purpose"
 curio.121.desc:0 "Based of what few artifacts exist that can be dated after this point it seems the new government did not last long. Many citizens struggled to adapt to the new way of life, with generations having dedicated their entire existence to travelling to this star the lack of such a clear purpose filled much of the population with an existential dread. The goverment tried it's best to help stabilise things though intervention initiatives and propaganda, but several high profile mass suicides eroded the publics confidence in the goverment as well as their sanity.\nMany, many mass deaths soon followed.\n\nIt is believed that some survived these difficult times however they seem to have collectively decided to not procreate any further. Having seen their friends, family, neighbours and coworkers all take their own lives a decision was reached to not curse their offspring with this purposelessness."
